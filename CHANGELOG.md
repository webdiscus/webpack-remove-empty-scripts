## 1.0.0 (2022-09-12)
- BREAKING CHANGE: reverted default behavior as in `v0.8.1` - remove empty scripts before other plugins will be called.
  This change is needs for properly work of the vast majority of webpack plugins.

  For compatibility with `v0.8.2 - v0.8.4`, if you have an issue, use new `stage` option with the value:
  ```js
  new RemoveEmptyScriptsPlugin({
    stage: RemoveEmptyScriptsPlugin.STAGE_AFTER_PROCESS_PLUGINS,
  })
  ```
- feat: added new `stage` option.
  Webpack plugins use different stages for their functionality.
  For properly work other plugins can be specified the `stage` when should be removed empty scripts: before or after processing of other webpack plugins.\
  For example, using `@wordpress/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin` the empty scripts must be removed `after` processing all plugins.
  Using `webpack-manifest-plugin` the empty scripts must be removed `before` processing other plugins.

## 0.6.0 (Oct 13, 2020)
Being overly careful here, this version is not breaking for almost all the existing users. 
It could possibly break in some edge cases, since it changes how modules are collected (from global to one each compilation) 
or if you have a workaround for a working webpack multi configuration.
