## 0.6.1 (Oct 20, 2020)
The fork of original `https://github.com/fqborges/webpack-fix-style-only-entries` (ver. 0.6.0) for support only Webpack 5 and above.

The changes from original version 0.6.0: 
 
- Added the feature: considers the use hash after the  .js and .mjs extension in file format like `.js?[hash]` or `.mjs?[hash]`. 
The idea and requirement belong to https://github.com/MatiasMorici from PR https://github.com/fqborges/webpack-fix-style-only-entries/pull/27/commits/57eeecbcb85926578770c3845465e4012b02a196

    - DEP_WEBPACK_CHUNK_HAS_ENTRY_MODULE
    - DEP_WEBPACK_CHUNK_ENTRY_MODULE
    - DEP_WEBPACK_DEPRECATION_ARRAY_TO_SET
    - DEP_WEBPACK_MODULE_INDEX
 
- Update all packages for Webpack 5.
- Fix integration test script for using with Webpack 5.
- Fix a BUG of `terser-webpack-plugin` (generate the futile file `vendor.js.LICENSE.txt`) in the production test `vendor+multi-js-entry-css-entry`.
- Fix module structure in README.md.

## 0.6.0 (Oct 13, 2020)
Being overly careful here, this version is not breaking for almost all the existing users. It could possibly break in some edge cases, since it changes how modules are collected (from global to one each compilation) or if you have a workaround for a working webpack multi configuration.
